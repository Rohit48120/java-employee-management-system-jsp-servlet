This Java project is a simple employee management system created using JSP and Servlets as part of our Java mini project. It enables employees to register and log in, while administrators have access to functions such as managing employee accounts, overseeing leave requests, department creation and management, project assignment, and tracking project progress. Employees can view their personal information, request leave, and provide updates on project tasks. While the system may lack advanced features and may encounter some unhandled user exceptions, given our status as students, we couldn't develop a fully dynamic, feature-rich, and interactive frontend. Nevertheless, our aim was to provide a fundamental understanding of Java web development. For example, in this project we have placed both Admin and Employee login sections on the same page, but we later learned that it's best practice to keep the Admin login hidden from Employee login, as per our teacher's advice.
